# Peppy (molpath)

VR molecular modelling pathfinding project

<b>goals:</b>

visualisation / teaching / molecular modelling 'sketching' 

encourage experiential learning about polypeptide properties and conformation through play

<b>features:</b>

interactive polypeptide backbone built from simple primitives

Unity physics joints used to represent bonded / non-bonded interactions (e.g. dihedrals / hydrogen bonds)

basic electrostatics

simple dynamics

not intended to be a simulation
