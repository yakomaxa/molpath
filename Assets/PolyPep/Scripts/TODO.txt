TODO after dirty-rescaling: 2019/06/11
(0) Do similar work on joint responsible for Hydrogen-bonds.They are not scaled now.
(1) Scaling sidechains. Now proxy sidechain is disabled so that it's a backbone-only model.
(2) Re-re-scaling boxes on ramachandran plane. They do explode or get tiny when ppd is scaled !!
(3) Compose UI. I may use scale-test UI hidden.
